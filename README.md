# 21-Days-of-Code
I am trying to get into the habit of programming regularly, and what better way to do so than to take it up for 21 days. The questions that I will be picking will be " Top 20 Dynamic Programming Questions " from GeeksForGeeks (link given below). My main focus will be understanding all the ways of solving a problem, time complexity, and documenting my understanding of it in detail. I will try to keep a linkedIn thread, but honestly, I feel more comfortable in writing it all down first. Once I am done with the paper and pen documentation, I will update it on linkedIn and share the link here.

Here's to learning!
